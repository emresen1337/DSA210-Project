# DSA210-Project

## Project Description
This project investigates the hypothesis: “There is a correlation between daily screen time and active energy expenditure.”
In an increasingly digital world, screen time is a very common part of our daily routines. Simultaneously, health and wellness are heavily influenced by physical activity. Understanding the relationship between these variables could provide valuable insights into lifestyle balance and wellness.

To explore this hypothesis, I will analyze data collected from my phone’s and laptop’s screen time trackers alongside active energy data from my health app.

## Dataset
### Screen Time
  •	Phone: Daily usage statistics from iOS Screen Time.
  
  •	Laptop: Screen time logs from macOS Screen Time.
### Active Energy
  •	Extracted from iOS Health App.
  
  •	Represents the calories burned during active movement, excluding basal metabolic rate (BMR).

## Project Plan
### Data Collection
  •	Set up automated tools or manual methods to log daily screen time and active energy.
  
  •	Ensure all data is recorded in a standardized format for easy processing.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  •	Handle missing or incomplete data.
  
  •	Normalize units and formats (e.g., converting time into minutes, aggregating screen time).
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  •	Visualize screen time and active energy trends over time.
  
  •	Identify patterns, outliers, and potential correlations.
### Hypothesis Testing
  •	Use statistical tests (e.g., Pearson or Spearman correlation) to measure the relationship between screen time and active energy.
  
  •	Evaluate the hypothesis and document findings.
### Modeling
  •	Develop predictive models (e.g., linear regression) to quantify how screen time impacts active energy expenditure.
### Conclusion and Insights
  •	Summarize findings and their implications for lifestyle management.
  
  •	Suggest potential future research directions.
