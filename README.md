# DSA210-Project

## Project Description
This project explores the relationship between daily screen time and active energy expenditure. The hypotheses for this investigation are:
  •	Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no correlation between daily screen time and active energy expenditure.

  •	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant correlation between daily screen time and active energy expenditure.

In today’s digital world, screen time is a common part of everyday life. At the same time, physical activity plays a crucial role in maintaining health and wellness. By analyzing the relationship between these factors, this project aims to provide valuable insights into achieving a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

To explore this hypothesis, I will analyze data collected from my phone’s and laptop’s screen time trackers alongside active energy data from my health app.

## Dataset
### Screen Time
  •	Phone: Daily usage statistics from iOS Screen Time.
  
  •	Laptop: Screen time logs from macOS Screen Time.
### Active Energy
  •	Extracted from iOS Health App.
  
  •	Represents the calories burned during active movement, excluding basal metabolic rate (BMR).

## Project Plan
### Data Collection
  •	Set up automated tools or manual methods to log daily screen time and active energy.
  
  •	Ensure all data is recorded in a standardized format for easy processing.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  •	Handle missing or incomplete data.
  
  •	Normalize units and formats (e.g., converting time into minutes, aggregating screen time).
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  •	Visualize screen time and active energy trends over time.
  
  •	Identify patterns, outliers, and potential correlations.
### Hypothesis Testing
  •	Use statistical tests (e.g., Pearson or Spearman correlation) to measure the relationship between screen time and active energy.
  
  •	Evaluate the hypothesis and document findings.
### Modeling
  •	Develop predictive models (e.g., linear regression) to quantify how screen time impacts active energy expenditure.
### Conclusion and Insights
  •	Summarize findings and their implications for lifestyle management.
  
  •	Suggest potential future research directions.
